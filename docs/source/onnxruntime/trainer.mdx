# Trainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] classes provide APIs for training PyTorch models with [ONNX Runtime(ORT)](https://onnxruntime.ai/).
Taking ONNX Runtime as backend, [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] optimize the computation graph and the memory usage. They also support
mixed precision training implemenred by ORT, as well as distributed training on multiple GPUs. With them, you will be able to achieve shorter
latency, larger throughput, and larger maximum batch size while training large transformers models.

## Installation

To use ONNX Runtime for training, you need a machine with at least one NVIDIA or AMD GPU.

You can install the following dependencies in a local Python environment(for torch_ort 1.12.0 with CUDA 11.3):

```bash
pip install onnx==1.12.0 ninja
pip install onnxruntime-training==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.onnxruntime.ai/onnxruntime_stable_cu113.html
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-ort
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
pip install --upgrade protobuf==3.20.1
```

And run post-installation configuration:

```bash
python -m torch_ort.configure
```

It is __strongly recommended__ to setup your environment with Docker. You can find dockerfiles with more combinations [here]
(https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker).


## ORTTrainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] class is similar to the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Trainer` of transformers with `ORTTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTTrainer` compared with `Trainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer

# Step 1: Create your ONNX Runtime Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = ORTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+    feature="sequence-classification",  # Determine the LM during inference with ORT
)

# Step 2: Use ONNX Runtime for training!ðŸ¤—
train_result = trainer.train()
```
