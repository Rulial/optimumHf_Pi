# Trainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] classes provide APIs for training PyTorch models with [ONNX Runtime(ORT)](https://onnxruntime.ai/).
Taking ONNX Runtime as backend, [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] optimize the computation graph and the memory usage. They also support
mixed precision training implemented by ORT, as well as distributed training on multiple GPUs. With them, you will be able to achieve shorter
latency, larger throughput, and larger maximum batch size while training large transformers models.

## Prerequisite

To use ONNX Runtime for training, you need a machine with at least one NVIDIA or AMD GPU.

To use `ORTTrainer` or `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`, you need to install ONNX Runtime Training module and Optimum.

### Install ONNX Runtime

To setup the environment, we __strongly recommend__ you to install the dependencies with Docker to ensure that the versions are correct and well
configured. You can find dockerfiles with various combinations [here](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker).

For example, if you want to install [nightly-built onnxruntime-training](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/Dockerfile-ort-nightly-cu113) via Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-ort-nightly-cu113 -t <imagename:tag> .
```

If you want to install the dependencies in a local Python environment. Here is an example of installing and configuring
`onnxruntime-training` 1.12.0. Before installing the dependencies, make sure that you have at least CUDA 10.2 well installed.

```bash
pip install onnx==1.12.0 ninja
pip install onnxruntime-training==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.onnxruntime.ai/onnxruntime_stable_cu113.html
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-ort
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
pip install --upgrade protobuf==3.20.1
```

And run post-installation configuration:

```bash
python -m torch_ort.configure
```

### Install Optimum

You can install Optimum via pypi:

```bash
pip install optimum
```

Or install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

This command installs the current main dev version of Optimum, which could include latest developments(new features, bug fixes). However, the
main version might not be very stable. If you run into any problem, please open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues) so
that we can fix it as soon as possible.

## ORTTrainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] class is similar to the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Trainer` of transformers with `ORTTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTTrainer` compared with `Trainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer

# Step 1: Create your ONNX Runtime Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = ORTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+    feature="sequence-classification",  # Determine the LM during inference with ORT
)

# Step 2: Use ONNX Runtime for training!ðŸ¤—
train_result = trainer.train()
```
