# Trainer

The `ORTTrainer` and `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` classes provide APIs for training PyTorch models with [ONNX Runtime(ORT)](https://onnxruntime.ai/).
Taking ONNX Runtime as backend, `ORTTrainer` and `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` optimize the computation graph and the memory usage. They also support
mixed precision training implemenred by ORT, as well as distributed training on multiple GPUs. With them, you will be able to achieve shorter
latency, larger throughput, and larger maximum batch size while training large transformers models.

## ORTTrainer

The `ORTTrainer` class is similar to the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Trainer` with `ORTTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTTrainer` compared with `Trainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer

# Step 1: Create your ONNX Runtime Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = ORTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+    feature="sequence-classification",  # Determine the LM during inference with ORT(unnecessary for training)
)

# Step 2: Use ONNX Runtime for training!ðŸ¤—
train_result = trainer.train()
```
