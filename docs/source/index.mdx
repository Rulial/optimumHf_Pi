# ðŸ¤— Optimum

ðŸ¤— Optimum is an extension of ðŸ¤— Transformers, providing a set of performance optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardware.

The AI ecosystem evolves quickly and more and more specialized hardware along with their own optimizations are emerging every day.
As such, ðŸ¤— Optimum enables users to efficiently use any of these platforms with the same ease inherent to ðŸ¤— Transformers.
